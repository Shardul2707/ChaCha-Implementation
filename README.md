# ChaCha-Implementation
It contains implementation of ARX-based Stream Cipher ChaCha used by Google.
Also, it contains code of Differential Attacks, Finding PNBs and finding backward bias with computation of Data and Time Complexities.
Other codes I couldn't able to share due to confidentiality agreement as paper is yet to be published. But, using and modifying these all codes we found a new attack on modified version of ChaCha for 7 rounds which was never attacked by anyone.
There is a paper too explaining the modified version of ChaCha.
